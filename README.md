## PINN - Physics-Informed Neural Network
[Notebook](https://github.com/jeffbparker/physicsML/blob/pinn/PINN/Physics_informed_neural_network.ipynb).  I build a PINN [[Raissi et al., (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125)] to solve the PDE Burgers equation, arising from fluid dynamics.  The trained neural network gives very good predictions to the true solution of the PDE (computed via direct numerical simulation).
