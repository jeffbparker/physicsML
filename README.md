## PINN - Physics-Informed Neural Network
I build a PINN [Raissi et al., (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125) to solve the PDE Burgers equation, arising from fluid dynamics.  The trained neural network gives very good predictions to the true solution of the PDE (computed via direct numerical simulation).
